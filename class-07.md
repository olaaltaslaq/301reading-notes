- ## 1. Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.


- ## 2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.

- ## 3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

this protocol Fielding and his friends created is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

- ## 4. What does a GET do?

when the systems would retrieve information from each other.

- ## 5. What does a POST do?

If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

- ## 6. What does PUT do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system.

- ## 7. What does PATCH do?

If a system wants to do partial update, it uses an HTTP verb of PATCH.
