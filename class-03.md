- ## What is functional programming?

*a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.*

- ## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

stable, consistent, and predictable functions. Given the same parameters, and will always return the same result.

- ## What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code’s easier to test.

- ## What is immutability?

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

- ## What is Referential transparency?

if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.



# Modules and require

![Module](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ljnWAuUhEYej-FQ2.jpeg)

- ## What is a module?

*JavaScript file, when we write a node.js application we don't typically dump all of our application code in one file so we split our code up into logical modules.*

- ## What does the word ‘require’ do?

if we want to use our functionality elsewhere in the application, we use ‘require’ function.

- ## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

We have to export it in it's file. then use ‘require’ function to use it in the other file.

- ## What do we have to do to make a module available?

We have to export it in it's file.
