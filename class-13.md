# CRUD

### 1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- 100’s = tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client.

- 200’s = tell the client that its request was accepted. In case of asynchronous processing of a request (202).

- 300’s = tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore.

- 400’s = These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server.

- 500’s = These are the server error codes. Often they indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies.

### 2. What is a status code 202?

- This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.

### 3. What is a status code 308?

- This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore.
