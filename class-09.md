# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## **Functional Programming Concepts**

### What is functional programming?

- a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- stable, consistent, and predictable functions. Given the same parameters, and will always return the same result.

### What are the benefits of a pure function?

- They are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments. They also makes maintaining and refactoring code much easier.

### What is immutability?

- Is the idea that data or objects should not be modified after they are created.

### What is Referential transparency?

- An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior.

## **Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()**

### What is a module?

- JavaScript file, when we write a node.js application we don't typically dump all of our application code in one file so we split our code up into logical modules.

### What does the word ‘require’ do?

- It resolves libraries and modules in the Node search path.

### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

- We have to export it in it's file. then use ‘require’ function to use it in the other file.

### What do we have to do to make a module available?

- Use module.export inside the module itself.
