## What is difference between state and props?


***"props" (short for "properties") is an object of arbitrary inputs a React function component accepts as the first argument. "state" is data that changes over the lifetime of a specific instance of a React component.***

## What types of things can you pass in the props?

*when you create a component inside a react and you want to render it you're going to pass it the props that you want to give to it.*

## What is the big difference between props and state?

*props is handel outside the Component and must be updated outside it. state is handel inside the Component and must be updated inside it.*

## When do we re-render our application?

*when you change the state inside of your application it's going to re-render that section.*

## What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

*we need state to store that thing that we're going to be updating like counts in the counter. and inside the form.*
